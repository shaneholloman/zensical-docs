# Repository

If your documentation is related to source code, Zensical provides the ability
to display information about the project's repository as part of the static site,
including stars and forks.

## Configuration

In order to display a link to the repository of your project as part of your
documentation, set `repo_url` in your configuration to the public URL of your
repository, e.g.:

=== "`zensical.toml`"
    ``` toml
    [project]
    repo_url = "https://github.com/zensical/zensical"
    ```

=== "`mkdocs.yml`"
    ``` yaml
    repo_url: https://github.com/zensical/zensical
    ```

The link to the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big
screens. Additionally, for public repositories hosted on [GitHub] or [GitLab],
the latest release tag[^1], as well as the number of stars and forks, are
automatically requested and rendered.

  [^1]:
    Unfortunately, GitHub only provides an API endpoint to obtain the [latest
    release] - not the latest tag. Thus, make sure to [create a release] (not
    pre-release) for the latest tag you want to display next to the number of
    stars and forks. For GitLab, although it is possible to get a [list of tags
    sorted by update time], the [equivalent API endpoint] is used. So, make sure
    you also [create a release for GitLab repositories].

  [latest release]: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release
  [create a release]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release
  [list of tags sorted by update time]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/tags.html#list-project-repository-tags
  [equivalent API endpoint]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#get-the-latest-release
  [create a release for GitLab repositories]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#create-a-release

### Repository name

Zensical will infer the source provider by examining the URL and try to set the
_repository name_ automatically. If you wish to customize the name, set
`repo_name` in your configuration:

=== "`zensical.toml`"

    ``` toml
    [project]
    repo_name = "zensical/zensical"
    ```

=== "`mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    repo_name: zensical/zensical
    ```

  [repo_name]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#repo_name

### Repository icon

While the default repository icon is a generic git icon, it can be set to
any icon bundled with the theme by referencing a valid icon path in
`mkdocs.yml`:

=== "`zensical.toml`"

    ``` toml
    [project.theme.icon]
    repo = "fontawesome/brands/git-alt"
    ```

=== "`mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    theme:
      icon:
        repo: fontawesome/brands/git-alt
    ```

You can use icons from any of the [available icon sets] or use one of these
popular choices:

  [available icon set]: ../authoring/icons-emojis.md#included-icon-sets

- :fontawesome-brands-git: – `fontawesome/brands/git`
- :fontawesome-brands-git-alt: – `fontawesome/brands/git-alt`
- :fontawesome-brands-github: – `fontawesome/brands/github`
- :fontawesome-brands-github-alt: – `fontawesome/brands/github-alt`
- :fontawesome-brands-gitlab: – `fontawesome/brands/gitlab`
- :fontawesome-brands-gitkraken: – `fontawesome/brands/gitkraken`
- :fontawesome-brands-bitbucket: – `fontawesome/brands/bitbucket`

### Code actions

If the [repository URL] points to a valid [GitHub], [GitLab] or [Bitbucket]
repository, Zensical provides a setting called `edit_uri`, which
resolves to the subfolder where your documentation is hosted.

If your default branch is called `main`, change the setting to:

=== "`zensical.toml`"

    ``` toml
    [project]
    edit_uri = "edit/main/docs/"
    ```

=== "`mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    edit_uri: edit/main/docs/
    ```

After making sure that `edit_uri` is correctly configured, buttons for code
actions can be added. Two types of code actions are supported: `edit` and `view`
(GitHub only):

=== "`zensical.toml`"

    ``` toml
    [project.theme]
    features = [
      "content.action.edit", # Edit this page
      "content.action.view"  # View source of this page
    ]
    ```

=== "`mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    theme:
      features:
        - content.action.edit # Edit this page
        - content.action.view  # View source of this page
    ```

The icon of the edit and view buttons can be changed with the following lines:

=== "`zensical.toml`"

    ``` toml
    [project.theme.icon]
    edit = "material/pencil"
    view = "material/eye"
    ```

=== "`mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    theme:
      icon:
        edit: material/pencil
        view: material/eye
    ```
